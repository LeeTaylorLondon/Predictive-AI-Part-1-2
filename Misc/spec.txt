Part II: Data Imputation and Predictive modelling.
Dataset:  we are going to use the same Houses data set from part I of this exercise.

The main learning task is a regression task, where you aim to predict the median house value  for each area.
This task is "interleaved" with the imputation task as per below.

This means that you will simultaneously work on both  data imputation and model training as part of this assignment.

Data Imputation. You are given both the complete dataset [Houses Links to an external site.], and a version of the
same where 0.5%  of the data is missing at random [Houses_0.5_MAR Links to an external site.]. The task is to compare
the effects of two imputation methods: KNN imputation and MICE, in combination with the learning task. Specifically,
you are required to:

Impute Houses_0.5_MAR using KNN imputation.
Then train a regression model for predicting house median price in an area,
 using the imputed dataset for training and note its performance, i.e, how well it predicts median house values.
Call this model M1 impute Houses_0.5_MAR Links to an external site.
Using MICE (Iterative Imputation). Then again train a regression model and note its performance.
Call this model M2 Compare M1 and M2.
Are there differences?
If so, why do you think they provide different performance?
Which one would you choose?
